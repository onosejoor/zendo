### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   Node.js (v18.x or later)
*   npm or Yarn or pnpm

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/onosejoor/zendo.git

    ```bash
    npm install

    ```
    Replace `YOUR_JWT_SECRET` with a strong, random secret key and `YOUR_BACKEND_SERVER_URL` with the URL of your backend server (e.g., `http://localhost:8080` if running locally).
