## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run Zendo on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Go**: Version 1.22 or higher.
*   **Node.js**: (v18 or higher) and npm/yarn for the frontend.
*   **MongoDB**: A running MongoDB instance. You can use a local installation or a cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas.
*   **Redis**: A running Redis instance. For development, a local setup is fine; for production, consider a managed service like Upstash.
*   **Cloudinary Account**: Required for image uploads (e.g., user avatars).
*   **Gmail Account**: For sending email verification and task reminder emails. You'll need an App Password if using Gmail directly.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/onosejoor/zendo.git
    cd zendo
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Server Directory and Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    cd server
    go mod tidy
    ```

3.  **Navigate to the Client Directory and Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

### Environment Variables

Before running the application, set up the following environment variables in a `.env` file in both the `server` and `client` directories.

**For `server/.env`:**

```
PORT=8080
DATABASE=zendo_db_name
MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<db-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
REDIS_UPSTASH_URL="rediss://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>"
ACCESS_SECRET="your_jwt_access_secret"
JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_refresh_secret" # This is used for refresh token and email secret
EMAIL="your_email@gmail.com"
APP_PASSWORD="your_gmail_app_password" # Generated from Google Account Security
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:3000" # Or your deployed frontend URL
CLIENT_URL="http://localhost:3000" # Or your deployed frontend URL
ENVIRONMENT="development" # or "production"

# Optional: Cloudinary for avatar uploads
CLOUDINARY_URL="cloudinary://<api_key>:<api_secret>@<cloud_name>"
UPLOAD_PRESET="your_cloudinary_upload_preset"

# Optional: Google OAuth
G_CLIENT_ID="your_google_client_id"
G_CLIENT_SECRET="your_google_client_secret"
G_REDIRECT="http://localhost:8080/auth/callback"

# Optional: Prometheus Basic Auth
METRICS_USERNAME="metricsuser"
METRICS_PASSWORD="metricspassword"
```

**For `client/.env.local`:**

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:8080" # Your backend server URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKUP_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:8080" # Backup backend server URL (can be same as primary for local)
```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server**:
    Navigate to the `server` directory and run:

    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

    The server will start on `http://localhost:8080` (or your specified `PORT`).

2.  **Start the Frontend Client**:
    Open a new terminal, navigate to the `client` directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev # or yarn dev
    ```
    The client application will typically start on `http://localhost:3000`.

## üí° Usage

The Zendo application provides a clean and intuitive interface for managing your tasks and projects. The backend exposes a RESTful API that can be consumed by any client application.

### Frontend Usage

Once the frontend is running:

1.  **Sign Up/Sign In**: Register a new account or log in using your email/password or Google OAuth.
2.  **Dashboard**: The main dashboard gives you an overview of your tasks, projects, and overall productivity statistics.
3.  **Manage Tasks**:
    *   Create new tasks with titles, descriptions, due dates, and statuses.
    *   Add sub-tasks to break down larger tasks.
    *   Mark tasks as pending, in-progress, or completed.
    *   View task details and receive email reminders for upcoming due dates.
4.  **Organize Projects**:
    *   Create projects to categorize and group related tasks.
    *   View all tasks associated with a specific project.
    *   Update project details and track their progress.
5.  **Collaborate with Teams (New Feature!)**:
    *   Create teams and invite other users to join.
    *   Assign tasks to team members within a project.
    *   Collaborate on shared tasks and track team progress.
6.  **User Settings**: Update your profile information, including username and avatar. Access the "Danger Zone" to delete all your tasks or projects (use with caution!).
