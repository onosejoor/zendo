## üöÄ Installation

To get Zendo up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Go**: Version 1.20 or newer
*   **Node.js**: Version 18 or newer
*   **npm** or **Yarn**
*   **MongoDB**: Local instance or access to a cloud-hosted instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
*   **Redis**: Local instance or access to a cloud-hosted instance (e.g., Upstash Redis)

### Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the Zendo repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onosejoor/zendo.git
cd zendo
```

### Backend Setup (Go)

1.  Navigate to the `server` directory:
    ```bash
    cd server
    ```
2.  Download the Go modules:
    ```bash
    go mod download
    ```
3.  Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory based on the `env.example` provided:
    ```
    PORT=8080
    MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
    REDIS_UPSTASH_URL="your_redis_connection_string"
    JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret_key"
    ACCESS_SECRET="your_access_secret_key"
    CLIENT_URL="http://localhost:3000" # Your frontend URL
    ORIGIN="http://localhost:8080" # Your backend URL
    # Optional: Cloudinary for avatar uploads
    CLOUDINARY_URL="cloudinary://api_key:api_secret@cloud_name"
    UPLOAD_PRESET="your_cloudinary_upload_preset"
    # Optional: Google OAuth
    G_CLIENT_ID="your_google_client_id"
    G_CLIENT_SECRET="your_google_client_secret"
    G_REDIRECT="http://localhost:8080/auth/callback" # Your backend redirect URL
    ```
    *Make sure to replace placeholder values with your actual credentials.*
4.  Start the Go server:
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```
    The server should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Frontend Setup (Next.js)

1.  Navigate to the `client` directory (from the project root):
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    ```
2.  Install the Node.js dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  Create a `.env.local` file in the `client` directory based on the `env.example` provided:
    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:8080" # Your backend URL
    ```
4.  Start the Next.js development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    The frontend application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

Once the server and client are running, you can start using Zendo:

1.  **Account Creation & Authentication**:
    *   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/auth/signup` to create a new user account.
    *   After successful registration, you'll be redirected to `http://localhost:3000/auth/signin` to log in using your newly created credentials.
2.  **Dashboard Overview**:
    *   Upon successful login, you'll land on your personal dashboard (`/dashboard`), which provides a quick overview of your task statistics, including total tasks, active projects, completion rate, and tasks due today.
3.  **Managing Tasks**:
    *   Navigate to the Tasks section via the sidebar or by visiting `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/tasks`.
    *   Click the "New Task" button to create a new task. You can specify a title, description, due date, status (pending, in-progress, completed), and optionally link it to an existing project.
    *   To modify a task, click on its card in the task list or navigate to its detail page (`/dashboard/tasks/[id]`). Use the "Edit Task" button to make changes.
    *   Easily mark tasks as completed directly from the task list by toggling their checkbox.
    *   Delete individual tasks or clear all your tasks from the settings page.
4.  **Managing Projects**:
    *   Access the Projects section via the sidebar or by visiting `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/projects`.
    *   Create new projects using the "New Project" button. Projects help you group related tasks effectively.
    *   To view all tasks associated with a specific project, click on the project card to navigate to its detail page (`/dashboard/projects/[id]`).
    *   Projects can be edited or deleted (which will also remove all linked tasks) from their respective detail pages.
5.  **User Settings**:
    *   Go to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/settings` to manage your profile.
    *   Update your username and upload a new avatar to personalize your account.
    *   The "Danger Zone" provides options to permanently delete all your tasks or all your projects. Please use these features with extreme caution as they are irreversible.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Secure User Authentication**: Robust user registration and login system with password hashing and JWT-based authentication for secure session management.

*   **Intuitive Project Organization**: Group tasks into distinct projects for streamlined organization and an improved overview of related work.
*   **Dynamic Dashboard Statistics**: A personalized dashboard provides real-time insights into your productivity with key metrics like total tasks, active projects, completion rate, and tasks due today.
*   **Efficient Data Handling**: Leverages MongoDB for persistent data storage and integrates Redis for high-performance data caching, significantly reducing database load and improving response times.
*   **Atomic Operations**: Ensures data integrity and consistency through MongoDB transactions for complex operations, such as deleting a project along with all its associated tasks.
