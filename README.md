# **Zendo: Streamlined Task Management**

<!-- --- -->
<!-- 
**A quick note for recruiters**: While this request specified an "Objective-C project," the provided file structure and code context clearly indicate a full-stack application built with **Go (Golang)** for the backend and **Next.js (React/TypeScript)** for the frontend. This README has been generated based on the actual technologies detected in the project files to provide an accurate and detailed overview. -->

## üöÄ Installation

Ready to get Zendo up and running on your local machine? Follow these straightforward steps:

### 1. üìÇ Clone the Repository

First, grab the project files from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onosejoor/zendo.git
cd zendo
```

### 2. ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Setup (Go)

Navigate into the `server` directory and prepare your Go environment:

üëâ **Dependencies**:
Ensure you have Go installed (version 1.24.2 or higher, as indicated in `go.mod`).

‚öôÔ∏è **Environment Variables**:
Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory. Populate it with the necessary variables. Here's an example of what your `.env` file might look like, based on the project's code:

```dotenv
PORT=8080
MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017" # Your MongoDB connection string
DATABASE="zendo_db" # Your MongoDB database name
JWT_SECRET="your_strong_refresh_token_secret" # Secret for refresh tokens
ACCESS_SECRET="your_strong_access_token_secret" # Secret for access tokens
EMAIL_SECRET="your_strong_email_token_secret" # Secret for email verification tokens
REDIS_UPSTASH_URL="redis://default:YOUR_REDIS_PASSWORD@YOUR_REDIS_HOST:PORT" # Your Redis connection URL (e.g., from Upstash)
EMAIL="your_email@gmail.com" # Email address for sending notifications (e.g., Gmail account)
APP_PASSWORD="your_gmail_app_password" # App password for the email account (generate this in Google account settings)
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:3000" # The URL where your frontend is hosted
CLIENT_URL="http://localhost:3000" # Used in CORS configuration (often same as FRONTEND_URL)
ORIGIN="http://localhost:8080" # The server's public URL, used for health checks
CLOUDINARY_URL="cloudinary://API_KEY:API_SECRET@CLOUD_NAME" # Your Cloudinary API environment variable
UPLOAD_PRESET="your_cloudinary_upload_preset" # Cloudinary upload preset name
```

üì¶ **Install Dependencies**:
From the `server` directory, fetch the Go modules:

```bash
cd server
go mod tidy
```

üöÄ **Run the Server**:
Start the Go backend application:

```bash
go run main.go
```
The server should now be listening on the port you specified in your `.env` file (defaulting to 8080).

### 3. üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Setup (Next.js)

Open a *new* terminal, navigate into the `client` directory, and prepare the frontend:

‚öôÔ∏è **Environment Variables**:
Create an `.env.local` file in the `client` directory. This project uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` for API routing. Make sure it points to your running backend:

```dotenv
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:8080"
```

üì¶ **Install Dependencies**:
From the `client` directory, install the Node.js packages:

```bash
cd client
npm install # or yarn install / pnpm install
```

üöÄ **Run the Frontend**:
Launch the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev # or yarn dev / pnpm dev
```
The frontend application should now be accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if configured).

## üí° Usage

Once both the backend and frontend are successfully running, Zendo is ready for you to explore and use!

1.  **Access the Application**:
    Open your favorite web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the address where your frontend is serving).

2.  **Sign Up / Sign In**:
    On the landing page, you'll find clear options to either "Get Started" (for new users to sign up) or "Login" (for existing users).
    *   **Sign Up**: Create your new Zendo account by providing your email, a unique username, and a secure password. An important step here is the email verification: a link will be sent to your registered email address. Verifying your email is crucial to unlock full application features, including automated task reminders.
    *   **Sign In**: If you're a returning user, simply enter your registered email and password to access your account.

3.  **Dashboard Overview**:
    Upon successful login, you'll be directed to your personalized dashboard. This intuitive interface provides a quick, high-level overview of your productivity metrics: total tasks, active projects, your overall task completion rate, and any tasks that are due today. It's designed to give you an immediate snapshot of your most pressing priorities.

4.  **Effective Task Management**:
    *   **Create New Task**: Whether from the dashboard's "New Task" button or the dedicated "Tasks" page in the sidebar, you can easily create new tasks. Each task allows you to specify a title, detailed description, due date, current status (pending, in-progress, completed), and an optional association with an existing project. For more complex items, you can even add subtasks to break down your work further.
    *   **View All Tasks**: Navigate to the "Tasks" section via the left sidebar to see a comprehensive list of all your tasks. The interface includes robust search and filter capabilities, enabling you to quickly locate specific tasks.
    *   **Edit Task Details**: Click on any task card or row to access its dedicated detail page. From here, you have the flexibility to modify any aspect of the task, including its title, description, status, and due date. You can also manage (add, edit, or remove) its subtasks directly on this page.
    *   **Mark as Complete**: Tasks can be effortlessly marked as "completed" by checking the corresponding checkbox directly from the dashboard overview or the main tasks list, providing immediate visual feedback on your progress.
    *   **Manage Subtasks**: For tasks requiring more granular steps, you can define multiple subtasks. Each subtask can be individually toggled to mark its completion, providing a clear breakdown of progress for complex objectives.

5.  **Organized Project Management**:
    *   **Create New Project**: Initiate new projects using the "New Project" button on your dashboard or by visiting the "Projects" page. Simply provide a project name and an optional description to get started.
    *   **Browse Projects**: The "Projects" section in the sidebar gives you a centralized view of all your organized projects.
    *   **Project-Specific Tasks**: Clicking on any project card will lead you to a dedicated page showcasing all tasks that are associated with that particular project. This view also allows you to add new tasks directly to the selected project, keeping everything neatly categorized.
    *   **Edit Project Details**: On the individual project's detail page, you can update its name or description as your project evolves.

6.  **Account Settings**:
    The "Settings" page offers comprehensive control over your Zendo account:
    *   **Profile Customization**: Update your personal information, including your username and the ability to upload a custom avatar to personalize your profile.
    *   **Danger Zone**: This section contains irreversible actions and should be used with extreme caution. Here, you have the option to permanently delete *all* your tasks or *all* your projects (which also deletes all associated tasks). Please be absolutely certain before proceeding with these actions.
