## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get Zendo up and running on your local machine.

### üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
*   **Go** (version 1.22 or higher)
*   **MongoDB**
*   **Redis**

### üì¶ Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/onosejoor/zendo.git
    cd zendo
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup (Go Fiber)**:
    *   Navigate to the server directory:
        ```bash
        cd server
        ```
    *   Install Go dependencies:
        ```bash
        go mod tidy
        ```
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory based on `env.example`:
        ```
        PORT=8080
        CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
        ORIGIN=http://localhost:8080
        MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
        JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret"
        ACCESS_SECRET="your_access_token_secret"
        REDIS_UPSTASH_URL="your_redis_connection_string"
        # Optional Google OAuth settings (uncomment in main.go if using)
        # G_CLIENT_ID=""
        # G_CLIENT_SECRET=""
        # G_REDIRECT="http://localhost:8080/auth/callback"
        # FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:3000"
        ```
        *Replace placeholder values with your actual credentials.*
    *   Run the Go server:
        ```bash
        go run main.go
        ```
        The server will start on `http://localhost:8080` (or your specified `PORT`).

3.  **Frontend Setup (Next.js)**:
    *   Navigate to the client directory:

        cd ../client
        ```
    *   Install Node.js dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   Create a `.env.local` file in the `client` directory based on `env.example`:
        ```
        NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:8080"
        ```
    *   Start the Next.js development server:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
